## 🚀 Features

- **Python Expertise**: Provides solutions, code snippets, and explanations for Python-related queries.
- **Debugging Assistance**: Helps identify and debug issues in your code with useful print statements and suggestions.
- **Code Documentation**: Automatically generates explanations and comments for code.
- **Solution Design**: Offers high-level design and architectural suggestions for software development.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before using this app, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.7+ installed on your system.
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) installed (`pip install streamlit`).
- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/) installed (`pip install langchain`).
- Ollama's API endpoint running locally on your machine. (You need to install Ollama and run their server on `http://localhost:11434`)

## 🔧 Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

To get started, install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install streamlit langchain langchain_ollama
```

### 2. Set up Ollama

Make sure you have Ollama installed and running locally. Visit [Ollama's website](https://ollama.ai/) for detailed instructions on installation and configuration.

### 3. Clone or Download the Repository

Clone the repository (or create a new file) containing your code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TanushreeSB/deepseek.git
cd deepseek
```

## 🚀 Running the App

To start the Streamlit app, run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 🖥️ How It Works

- **User Interaction**: The user types a programming-related question in the input box.
- **AI Response Generation**: The system prompts the Ollama model for an appropriate response, which can be a code solution, debug suggestion, or documentation.
- **Chat Interface**: All interactions are logged and displayed in a chat-like interface, allowing users to have ongoing conversations with the AI assistant.

### Configuration Options
- **Model Selection**: Choose between two pre-configured models: `deepseek-r1:1.5b` or `deepseek-r1:3b`. These models differ in their capability and performance.
- **Customization**: Modify the system prompt to change how the assistant responds (concise, debug-friendly, etc.).

## 💡 Code Explanation

### Streamlit Interface

- **Main UI**: The main user interface displays a chat interface for interacting with the AI assistant. It uses Streamlit's layout capabilities for the chat experience.
  
- **Sidebar**: Contains options to configure the model and other settings.

### Core Components

1. **System Message**: The `system_prompt` defines the AI's behavior, guiding it to act as a concise coding assistant.

2. **Message Log**: All user inputs and AI responses are stored in `st.session_state.message_log`, ensuring the chat history is maintained across interactions.

3. **Chat Interface**: A custom chat interface is created using Streamlit components to display both user and AI messages.

4. **Response Generation**: Upon receiving user input, the app constructs a prompt chain using `LangChain` and sends it to Ollama for processing.

5. **Reset**: A button is provided to clear the chat history and restart the interaction.
